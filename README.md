**OBJECTIVE**:
Face detection from training images.

## **Steps and tasks::** 

* Import the dataset.
* Create features (images) and labels (masks).
* Mask detection model:
  - U-net along with pre-trained transfer learning models
  - Design  Dice Coefficient and Loss function.
  - Train, tune, and test the model.
  - Evaluate the model using testing data.
  
* Predict the image” using the designed model and display the output of the image.

  **Dataset**:

The dataset contains 10,770 images of 100 individuals, all sourced from Pinterest and aligned using the dlib library. 
This dataset is commonly known as the "Pins Face Recognition" dataset.
